OpenWeather API used to search weather of different cities with image icons for the weather type.

Example: 
    - If the weather is sunny, then a sunny icon will be displayed.
    - If the weather is drizzle, then a drizzle icon will be displayed.


Just create your own OpenWeather API key and start playing.

Output images in the project structure.
